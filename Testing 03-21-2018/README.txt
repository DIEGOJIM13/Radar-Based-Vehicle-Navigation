4. Walking forward and backwards twice per test at a normal walking pace. Starting distance was 6ft each way. Radars were about 2ft apart. (0.bin and 1.bin work for both.)

5. Walking forward and backwards twice per test but at slower. Starting distance was 6ft each way. Radars were about 2ft apart. (No valid test data for both of them)

6. Walking from side to side of the radar modules at a normal walking rate. Walked first in front of passenger then in front of driver. Then turned around and walked in front of driver and then passenger. Then that was repeated for each test. At closes point person was about 3ft away from each radar module. Radars were about 2ft apart. (0.bin works for both.)

7. Same as previous experiment but person was about 1ft away from away radar module at the closes point. (3.bin works for both)
